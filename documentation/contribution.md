## Issues
Issues can be submitted [here](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/tagging_tracker_backend/issues).
 To ensure the quality of issues and a timely fix, the following guidelines
 include the following:

### Problem Issues
1. Issues should be clearly communicated, correct spelling and grammar helps.
1. Issues should include any relevant log information pertaining to the
 problem at hand (if applicable).
1. Issues should include details to replicate the issue (if applicable).

### Feature Requests
Feature requests are **strongly** encouraged to be submitted as pull requests.
 Otherwise, feature requests should be submitted with a title noting that the
 issue submitted is a feature request.

## Submitting Pull Requests
Pull requests will be handled through github.com. To create a pull request,
 simply fork the repository, make your change, and submit it
 [here](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/tagging_tracker_backend/pulls).

### Commit Guidelines
In order to ensure a smooth submission, make sure to tick each of the
 checkboxes. This is meant as a reference to ensure quality submissions.

Often, pull requests are constructed with multiple commits. Each of the
 following apply at a per-commit level.

- [ ] **A commit has a clear and concise summary**

A commit summary is synonymous with commit title.

- [ ] **A commit has a message outlining the purpose of the commit**

It's OK for the message of the commit to be a single sentence or the
 same as the title so long as the message and purpose of the commit is clear.
 Correct grammar is extremely helpful.

Include in your messages any information directly pertaining to the issue
 being solved at hand. If there's error messages from the app, include them
 in the message. If there's an issue a commit corresponds to, then link that
 issue into the message.

- [ ] **A commit does not contain an error that breaks the Python interpreter**

### Contributor Expectations
Contributors are expected to make appropriate updates to their pull requests
 as requested by the core team members or others in the community.

### Core Team Member Expectations
Though the projects core maintainers are busy people, they will try to put
 forth the effort to review and or apply pull requests on a weekly basis.
 This schedule will typically align
 with [Hack Nights](http://www.meetup.com/KCBrigade/).

### Become a Core Team Member
Consistently show up to [Hack Nights](http://www.meetup.com/KCBrigade/)
 and participate with the group. There might be wine, and it's a fun time all
 around.

## Release Schedule
Periodic updates are likely to coincide with
 [Hack Nights](http://www.meetup.com/KCBrigade/).
