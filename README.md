# tagging_tracker

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository:

`git clone http://www.github.com/codeforkansascity/tagging_tracker`

Next, create a virtualenv, then install the requirements:

```
cd tagging_tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Note: not setting up a virtualenv means that packages will be installed on your
system's Python interpreter. This carries risks. Don't know what virtualenv is? Google it!_
